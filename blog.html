            <p class="blog-content">
                I have been using PyCharm for a couple of years now, and I like its interface and overall functionality. There are some perks to the Enterprise version, 
              and I always preferred PyCharm over other Python IDEs. A couple of months ago, I shifted to using everything, even computationally simple tasks, on my 
              university server because I didn’t want to overload my beloved old computer. Following that, I wanted to write scripts on my local IDE but run them on 
              the server. After a quick Google search, I realized that VS Code was the best option for this setup. However, I was not ready to let go of my beloved PyCharm.
              
              I spent the next couple of weeks trying to make it work but with no success. One time it worked, but the connection, script execution, and output were so slow that using the server’s computational power wasn’t offering any real benefit. Finally, I gave up on PyCharm and switched to VS Code. To my surprise, I downloaded a couple of extensions, and it worked like magic. I could load VS Code, connect to the server, and start writing code in less than a minute. Life has been much easier since then.

This experience taught me that sometimes in life, I need to choose something I don’t prefer. I might like something, and that something might even be the best option out there. However, it might not serve my purpose. PyCharm is a great IDE, but it wasn’t letting me get where I wanted to be.

In life, there are many preferences that might be stopping me from reaching where I should be. These preferences can include my habits, the environment I live in, the people around me, or even the lifestyle I’ve chosen. It is my responsibility to analyze whether these preferences are preventing me from achieving my goals. And when I identify those preferences, I need to replace them—just like I replaced PyCharm, an amazing IDE, with VS Code, an IDE that’s serving my goals. Life will be much, much easier with one simple change.
